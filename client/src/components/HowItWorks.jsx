            instructions are followed to the latter.

            <b>The process:</b>All completed orders must pass through the
            quality assurance department once our support receives the final
            draft. Papers are usually done with utmost professionalism, so we do
            not expect major issues. The necessary changes are made to ensure
            you receive top-notch work.
